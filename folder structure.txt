my notes


balancing Lambda for light event processing and AWS Glue for heavier, scalable data ETL makes for a clean,
optimized architecture. Here’s the best practice design pattern based on your use case and real-world enterprise setups:

Upload ZIP → S3 Event → Lambda (light unzip & place raw) → Step Function (or EventBridge) → 
AWS Glue Job (partition, clean, validate, write)

df.writeTo("iceberg_catalog.db.bronze_sales_orders").partitionedBy("createddate").createOrReplace()


Layer   | Service       | Responsibilities
Raw     | S3            | Temporary storage of zipped files
Lambda  | AWS Lambda    | Lightweight ZIP extraction, upload to Bronze
Bronze  | AWS Glue      | Load raw CSVs, validate, clean, store in Iceberg Bronze with partitioning
Silver  | AWS Glue      | Enrich data, joins with dimension tables, deduplicate, SCD logic, QC etc.
Gold    | AWS Glue      | Curated data for analytics (facts, dims, SCD Type 3, KPIs)


Ah, excellent question, and it gets to the heart of event-driven ingestion integrity and deduplication.

If your pipeline is triggered 3–5 times per day with ZIPs containing overlapping or incremental data (or even replays), you must build idempotency and tracking into your architecture to ensure:

Step  | Tool          | Action
1.      Upload ZIP    | S3                        | Raw upload
2.      Trigger       | Lambda                    | Unzip + upload CSVs to Bronze S3
3.      Register File | Lambda                    | Log file metadata into DynamoDB or S3
4.      Start ETL     | Step Function/EventBridge | Start Glue Bronze job
5.      Process       | Glue                      | Read file, validate, de-dupe, write to Iceberg
6.      Track         | Glue                      | Update metadata table with processing status



Component                               | Purpose
S3 (raw/bronze)                         | Store original and extracted CSVs
Lambda                                  | Unzips files, uploads to bronze paths, updates DynamoDB
DynamoDB                                | Metadata registry (file tracking)
Glue Job (Bronze ELT)                   | Reads NEW files from DynamoDB, processes and deduplicates them, writes to Iceberg
Iceberg Table (Bronze Layer)            | Stores cleaned bronze-level data
Step Function or EventBridge (optional) | Orchestrate flows end-to-end




Medallion Architecture in AWS Glue (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
Bronze Layer (Raw Data):
    This layer stores raw data ingested from various sources (e.g., S3, databases, APIs). It's typically used for historical data that has not yet been transformed or cleaned.

    Data: Raw, unstructured, or minimally processed data.

    Glue Jobs: Simple jobs that load the data into S3 or a raw staging area.

    Schema: May not have a clean schema; schema drift is expected.

    In the context of your Glue pipeline:

    You might load raw event logs, transaction data, or IoT sensor data from S3 or a relational database (e.g., MySQL, RDS).

    For example, bronze/ contains raw JSON or CSV files as they are ingested.

Silver Layer (Cleansed Data):
    This layer involves transforming the raw data into a more structured form. Data quality is improved, and cleansing or simple transformation processes (e.g., filtering, deduplication) are applied.

    Data: Cleaned, filtered, and enriched raw data.

    Glue Jobs: ETL jobs that clean the raw data, apply transformations (like standardization or filling missing values), and enrich it.

    Schema: More structured than the Bronze layer; typically uses a standardized schema.

    For example, Glue jobs in the silver/ layer may:

    Cleanse and filter customer data, removing duplicates or fixing issues like inconsistent date formats.

    Join data from multiple sources (e.g., customer details and purchase records).

Gold Layer (Curated Data):
    This layer holds high-quality, business-ready data. It’s typically used for analytics, reporting, and machine learning. Data is fully transformed, aggregated, and optimized for consumption.

    Data: Aggregated, transformed, and ready for BI (business intelligence) or ML (machine learning).

    Glue Jobs: Jobs that aggregate, join, and perform advanced transformations to prepare the data for consumption by analytics tools, dashboards, or other downstream services.

    Schema: Highly structured data, often optimized for performance (e.g., partitioned, indexed).

    For example, in the gold/ layer, Glue jobs might:

    Aggregate the customer purchase behavior data (total sales by customer, ranking, etc.) and store it in a structured Parquet format for fast querying with Amazon Athena or Redshift.

    Perform transformations that are business-specific, like calculating customer lifetime value (CLV) or preparing data for a recommendation engine.


1. EventBridge detects new ZIP in S3 (Bronze layer)
2. Lambda triggered → Extracts file → Emits event(s) to EventBridge
3. Step Function triggered for Bronze ETL:
   - Run all Bronze jobs (parallel)
   - Wait → Poll → Check status of all Bronze jobs
4. After all Bronze succeed:
   - Trigger all Silver dimension jobs (parallel)
   - Wait → Poll → Check status of all Silver dimension jobs
5. If all Silver dimensions succeed:
   - Trigger Silver fact job(s)
6. If all succeed → Run Gold ETL
